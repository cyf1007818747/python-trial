As mentioned in the Overview, Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. 
Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as 
bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when 't' is included 
in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as str, the bytes having 
been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.File appended by Chris at 2024-03-29 01:17:21.114291
